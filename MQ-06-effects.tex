\chapter{Effects}

\textit{Mystic Quest} uses a quite elaborate system of effects and stats. Most of them are represented with icons in-game. A shame that they were not documented at all.

There is a little problem with the effects granted by armor and weapon to the companion: If you first load a late game savegame with a companion well equipped, and then start a new game, the effects of the savegame are not cleared. And your companions are much more beefy than they are supposed to be.

This bug coined the phrase: As soon as you load a game, you're cheating.
