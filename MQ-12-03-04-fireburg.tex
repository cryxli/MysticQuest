\subsection{Fireburg}
\label{map:fireburg}

First thing jumping to the eye is the hotel of \textit{Fireburg}. It houses a guy in a booth that sells \nameref{item:seed}s for 50 Gold each, an old lady selling \nameref{item:cure_potion}s for 25 each. And you can sleep for 95 gold per night. Just outside you find an old man
that sells \nameref{weapon:bomb}s for 10 Gold each.

The southwestern house has a gemini teleport pad to the northwestern house in \nameref{map:aquaria}. The women living there sells the \nameref{weapon:battle_axe} for 500 Gold.

In the northwestern house you'll meet \nameref{char:reuben}. He's upset because his father, \nameref{char:arion}, is traped in the \nameref{map:mine}. A friend of \nameref{char:arion} may help clearing it.

Bump into the door of the house in the pit that can only be acessed by claw climbing. Then talk to \nameref{char:tristam} who sits at the bar in the hotel. He'll give you the \nameref{item:multi_key}. Back to the pit. \nameref{char:arion}'s friend gives you \nameref{weapon:mega_grenade}s. The house also contains a mobius teleport pad.
