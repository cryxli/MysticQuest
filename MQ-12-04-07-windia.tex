\nameref{char:otto} is distracted. The wind from \nameref{map:mount_gale} broke the machine that created the bridge to \nameref{map:pazuzus_tower} to the north. His daugther \nameref{char:norma} is stuck in the tower.

The woman in the southwestern house sells the \nameref{armor:cupid_locket} for 300 Gold. Her husband sells \nameref{weapon:bomb}s for 10 Gold each. 

The inn has brown chests with \nameref{item:refresher}s and \nameref{item:heal_potion}s, respectively. You can sleep here for 95 Gold a night. The old woman at the counter sells \nameref{item:cure_potion}s for 25 Gold each.

The house to the north has brown chests with \nameref{item:heal_potion}s and \nameref{weapon:bomb}s. The old woman nearby sells \nameref{item:seed}s for 25 Gold each, once the wind stops. The house also has a mobius teleport pad to \nameref{map:ships_dock}.

The house in the northwest has a mobuis teleporter pad to the house in the pit in \nameref{map:fireburg}.
