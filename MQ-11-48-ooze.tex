	Strategy
	& \textit{Oozes} look like grey-colored \nameref{monster:slime}s but they have much stronger attacks. Nothing too bad though. Treat them how you would treat other members of this species - In other words, use \nameref{weapon:bomb}s. \\
	& They can reflect your magic though, so watch out.
