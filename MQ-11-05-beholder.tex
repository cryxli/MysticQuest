	Strategy
	& The main attack of Beholders is the \textit{Blind Flash}. Luckily, it isn't all that dangerous. Try to kill them before they're using their strong attack, which is \textit{Selfdestruct}. Yes, it will kill them, but it will also do huge damage. \\
	& Make sure not to use spells against them, or they'll reflect them.
