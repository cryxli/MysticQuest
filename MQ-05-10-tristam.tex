He’s a thief of unknown origin that for some reason helps the hero. He has already looted the \nameref{item:cure_potion_uniq} from the \nameref{map:sand_temple} and agrees to part with it, if the hero helps him explore the \nameref{map:bone_dungeon}.

He also teaches the hero the use of \nameref{weapon:bomb}s and provides the \nameref{item:multi_key} when met again in \nameref{map:fireburg}.

He’ll rejoin your party later but keeps his original loadout.
