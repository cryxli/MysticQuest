	& These guys are similar to \nameref{monster:brownie}s, but they wear green, and are stronger. \\
	& In addition to being stronger, they also have the \textit{Stare} ability as it can confuse you. They have one new attack as well, \textit{Kick}. It's pretty much the same as punch though, just with a different name.
