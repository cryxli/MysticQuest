	Strategy
	& \textit{Mad Toads} are dangerous. They have a bunch of status affects they can hit you with, including Petrify. They're also able to lower your magic, with \textit{Electrapulse}. In addition to that, they can counter your physical attacks by poisoning you. \\
	& Just try to kill them before they petrify you.
