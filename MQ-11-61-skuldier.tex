	Strategy
	& Try to take them out quickly, before they get a chance to use \textit{Doom Powder} - it's an attack that means instant death if it hits. \\
	& Because they are undead monsters, you can hit them with White magic to do some damage, they are weak against it. They are also weak against Wind attacks.
