\chapter{Spells}

The magic system of Mystic Quest is divided into three categories of magic: White, Black and Wizard. Charges are shared among one category.

You can refill charges by sleeping in a bed, usually in an Inn, or by eating Seeds.

Only the hero learns spells. Companions come with their preset selection of spells, if any.

The attack abilities of monsters may look and feel like spells, but are not named after spells, usually.
