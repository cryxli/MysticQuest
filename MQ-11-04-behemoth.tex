	Strategy
	& This fight isn't hard. You only have one weapon, and no items or spells though. Keep choosing to attack, and he should die. Although, it is possible to die, if he gets critical hits too much, you'll just start the battle over anyway, so don't worry about it. \textit{Horn} is just a physical attack.
