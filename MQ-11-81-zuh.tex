	Strategy
	& Use \nameref{spell:flare} every time it's Hero's turn, and have \nameref{char:phoebe} use \nameref{spell:white}. Keep doing this, and in one or two rounds Zuh's buddies, a \nameref{monster:chimera} and a \nameref{monster:thanatos}, will go down \\
	& Be careful of his \textit{Psyche-Shield}, attack which does repel your magic attacks.
