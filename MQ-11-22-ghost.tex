	Strategy
	& Ghosts are capable of lowering your attack power, for the course of the battle. Be aware that a physical attack may result with them countering you, with a confusion attack. \\
	& They can also multiply themselves. Doing so creates a copy with their current HP. \\
	& If you use Curing items or potions on them, they'll take damage, due to them being undead monsters.
