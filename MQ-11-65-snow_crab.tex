	Strategy
	& Snow Crab has two desert hags with him, when you fight. Have Hero use his \nameref{weapon:bomb}s on all of them, while \nameref{char:phoebe} uses \nameref{spell:thunder}, on Snow Crab alone. \\
	& If he confuses you, heal it. Keep doing damage, and using Hero to heal whenever sufficient damage is done to your team, and you'll come out of the fight victorious.
