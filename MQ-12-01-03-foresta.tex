\subsection{Foresta}
\label{map:foresta}

The town of Foresta seems to be inhabited by old people only. But that is just the effect of the corrupted earth crystal.

In the northeastern most tree stump house you meet the old man from the \nameref{map:level_forest}. He offers the hero the content of the chest in the back of the house. You have to reenter the house from the back jumping over the stream. The chest contains the \nameref{spell:cure} spell. Note that you can move a single barrel and also jump over a single barrel...

In the southeastern most house you meet \nameref{char:kaeli} and her mother. Show them the \nameref{item:tree_wither} and \nameref{char:kaeli} joins you to investigate the \nameref{map:level_forest}.

You can sleep in the southeastern most house for free to replenish HP and magic points.
