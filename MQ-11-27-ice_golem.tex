	Strategy
	& Have \nameref{char:phoebe} and Hero use \nameref{spell:fire} every turn unless they’re healing. \\
	& \nameref{spell:thunder} works decently, too. \\
	& When you run out of magic, use their normal attacks. \nameref{weapon:bomb} and \nameref{weapon:steel_sword} work about the same for Hero. \\
	& Watch out for his attacks, as almost all will do over 200 damage per turn. Keep healed up until he’s completely melted. \\
	& \textit{Snowstorm} will also heal him. \\
	& \textit{Stomp} does massive damage.
