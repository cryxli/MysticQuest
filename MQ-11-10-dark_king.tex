	Strategy
	& Have Hero use \nameref{spell:flare}, and have Phoebe use \nameref{spell:white}. Also, since \nameref{spell:flare} should be doing more damage, have Phoebe be in charge if curing and using seeds. \\
	& Soon, he'll grow more arms, and get stronger, and have more defense. Keep hitting him the same, though - and remember, healing is crucial. Most of his attacks do 500+ damage per turn - Often to both characters. Heal as soon as/if someone dies, and keep attacking. \\
	& Soon, he'll transform again, into a Spider. From here, watch out for \textit{Mega White} and \textit{Mega Flare}, as they're both very strong. Soon his arms will singe. Keep whacking away at his HP, and he'll finally die. \\
	Alternatively, speedrunners use \nameref{spell:cure} on him.

	Weakness
	& You can use \nameref{spell:cure} on him to do 15,000+ damage!
