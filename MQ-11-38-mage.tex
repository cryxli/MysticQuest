	Strategy
	& Mages don't have any physical attacks. They'll rely on \textit{Blizzard} to do damage to you. Occasionally, they'll try to be tricky, and use \textit{Muffle}, which causes silence, though Hero and \nameref{char:phoebe} are both immune to silence attacks, so it's a waste. \\
	& They do have one useful move though, cure. Just use a few normal attacks, and they'll go down.
