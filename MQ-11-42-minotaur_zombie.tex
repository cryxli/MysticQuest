	Strategy
	& Like the normal \nameref{monster:minotaur}, he will attack with \textit{Axe}, to do damage. But this guy prefers inflicting status effects. \textit{Blinder} blinds you, and \textit{Stare} will make you confused. \\
	& Try to take him out with \nameref{weapon:bomb}s, if he's alone, or with your companion's weapon, before he's able to cause any large amount of damage on you. \\
	& Since he's undead, he'll take damage from \nameref{spell:cure}.
