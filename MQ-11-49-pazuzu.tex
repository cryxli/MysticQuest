	Strategy
	& Pazuzu can easily do over 500 damage, with his attacks, but at least he fights alone. \\
	& Use \nameref{spell:aero} each turn. Your party should be able to deal about 3000 damage or so, per turn. \\
	& Heal both characters when their HP drops below about 600 to survive his next attack. \\
	& When he covers himself with his wings the \textit{Psych Shield} is activated. He then attacks three times before covering himself again marking the end of \textit{Psych Shield}. While \textit{Psych Shield} is active heal up or attack with physical attacks. Don’t use magic, or you’ll knock yourself out!
