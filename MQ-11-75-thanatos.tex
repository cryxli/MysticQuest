	Strategy
	& These guys are miniature versions of \nameref{monster:dullahan}. While not incredibly strong, they aren't weak either. \\
	& Hit them with a few strong attacks, or spells. \nameref{spell:meteor} works great. \\
	& Watch out for \textit{Doom Dance}, and you should survive the fight easily enough.
