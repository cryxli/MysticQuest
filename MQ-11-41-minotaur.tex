	Strategy
	& Attack every turn, but use \nameref{spell:cure} if either \nameref{char:kaeli} or Hero get low on health. \\
	& His axe attack is just a physical attack, but his \textit{Scream} ability will do damage, and also lower your defense. Also, be prepared for his \textit{Roundhouse}. It's also a physical attack, but it lays heavier damage. \\
	& Since he's an undead monster, \nameref{spell:life} spell will do massive damage to him.
