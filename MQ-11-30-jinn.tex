	Strategy
	& Start this fight by taking out the \nameref{monster:red_bone}s that fight with him. \\
	& After that have \nameref{char:reuben} attack every turn. Hero should use \nameref{spell:thunder} while it lasts, and then switch to \nameref{spell:quake}, when he's out of Wizard magic. \\
	& In addition, only the Hero should use \nameref{spell:cure} or otherwise healing, wheenver HP gets low - below 250 or so. \\
	& If the Hero dies, revive him immediately, otherwise have \nameref{char:reuben} concentrate on attacking only. \\
	& All of \textit{Jinn}'s attacks can be dangerous, especially \textit{Flame Pillar} which damages all party members considerably.
